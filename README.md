# Classification-of-Breast-Cancer-patients

This project aims to classify the patients into two categories. First category is patients having benign cancer and the other is those having malignant form of cancer. There are various classification algorithms which can be used for this purpose. I have used Logistic Regression and SVM models in my solution and provided different accuracy results from both. The functions are implemented using Scikit-learn.

Dataset was used from UCI Machine Learning repository.
